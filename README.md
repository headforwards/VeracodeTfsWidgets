# Veracode VSTS Widgets
Simple dashboard widget for VSTS that displays analysis metrics on your code base from Veracode.

This widget queries a simple WebApi wrapper around the Veracode API and retrieves the latest scan results for a given application. This data is then rendered into a dashboard widget based on the Query Tile shipped with VSTS.

The widget is linked to a simple configuration screen that allows the application id, user name and password to be specified per widget.
